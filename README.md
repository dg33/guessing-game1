Guessing game for 201 class demo

For Wednesday's assignment I made an about.html with info about me a mini biography and saved it under the projects/week1/guessing-game1 folder and impleneted that as a link in my index.html  file which is also in the projects/week1/guessing-game1 folder I did the same thing with my game.js folder which has my js I know it is supposed to be named app.js but I accidently saved another js as that.

My joke for you guys is one I got from one of my professor from SFU and after living in Vancouver for some years I find this to be true,  there is a little truth in every joke. What did the Canadian say to the American after the American stepped on the Canadian's foot?
The Canadian said sorry for my foot for being there.
